 What's For Dinner?
This Android app is designed to help people with deciding the ultimate question, what's for dinner?!

Usage Instructions:

Set up to be very intutive with the bottom bar navigation which will show Saved, Recommended(Rec), ShoppingList(FAB), Home, Search buttons.  These will take you to a saved recipes screen, recommended recipe screen, shopping list which recipes ingredients can be imported into and ingredients added a la carte. 

The search screen will take you to a search bar function which immediately comes into focus and will take speech and text input to search an API called Spoonacular which sources millions of recipes.  

Once a recipe is clicked upon it will take you to a "Let's Cook" (LargeRecipeScreen) which will show all recipe details (including a picture if in portrait mode) and will also list the ingredients. 

Saved, Recommended, & Search (recipe screens) are all swipeable to save(swipe to start if not already saveable this feature is there) otherwise wipe to end for Delete which is the only function for Saved recipes. 

Try out the two orientations to see the recipe information displayed in the format that is easiest for you(the user).
